## Inspiration
As three women of color navigating the challenges of institutional oppression, we felt extremely passionate about creating positive changes and movements that contribute towards social justice. With an increase in political activism, our team created a web page meant to attract organizers and protesters to unite in causes they are passionate for.

## What it does
Our website is essentially an organizer for political organizers. Activists can register their movement with our system and people who are drawn to similar causes can anonymously follow and attend the event. The website also included a link to a list of legal advise for those who decide to participate physically in protests and demonstrations. During the event, users are able to keep up from anywhere in the world with the live tweeter feed.

## How we built it
We build this web app with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HAML, and HTML. We also incorporated the gems and APIs such as devise, twitter, googlemap, and dotenv.

## Challenges we ran into
Two-thirds of our team are first time hackers, we dealt with unexpected challenges including novelty to languages and trouble setting up the coding environment. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a usable product after working for two days straight. This experience made us more confident and excited for future opportunities in hacking. 

## What we learned
We learned to learn on the spot through confusion and failure. Through experimenting with new gems, we learned to better understand documentations for third-party APIs.

## What's next for Know Your Rights
In the future, we hope to include more features such as live-streaming of the event, polls, and event customizations.
